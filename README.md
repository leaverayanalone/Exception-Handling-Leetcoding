This repository contains 15 programming assignments focused on Exception Handling. The goal of these exercises is to strengthen error-handling skills, ensure robust code execution, and learn best practices for handling unexpected runtime scenarios.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

Covers key concepts of exception handling in programming.

Includes practical assignments inspired by LeetCode-style problems.

Demonstrates usage of try, catch, finally, throw, and throws (depending on language).

Improves debugging, error recovery, and safe program termination techniques.
